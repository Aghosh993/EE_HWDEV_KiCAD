The SVG files in this directory are scalable plots of the top, bottom 
and various drill/paste layers of the MicroAHRS PCB.

The ERC and RPT extension files are plain text files auto-generated from 
KiCad's ERC and DRC tools, to verify schematic and layout correctness.

The rules against which the DRC operates are shown in the screenshots in 
drc_rules_1 and 2.
